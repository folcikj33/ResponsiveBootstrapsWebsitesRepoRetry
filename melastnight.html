    <h1>
      HI MY NAMES JAKE AHHH NO TIME TO EXPLAIN HAVE TO SUBMIT I THINK I'M BEING
      RECUUUUUURRRSSSSSSsssss....
    </h1>

    <!-- Okay, I have 25 minutes left on the clock, so I'm just gonna throw in the towel. I think that thing Poornima warned us about literally just today started happening to me with the whole don't-repo-your-own-folder-thing. 
  
  As for this assignment, I diecied to do the second half first, so this one is lacking the most (still waiting on my .io link to pull through, though... )

  Here, I have to stylize my page more by picking and choose frameworks from Bootstrap that resemble the portfolios shown. 
  
  I still have to finish filling out the portfolio itself and figure out why my images aren't working (I took them on photo-booth). 
  
  Then I should add a CSS file and stylize the page and see why my photos aren't working.
   
  Most important to this assignment I should make the layout responsive using rows and columns.

  Start with a row at the top (navbar)
  continue with columns row>col*3>row>col*2, etc.

  Hope this ones works better...
